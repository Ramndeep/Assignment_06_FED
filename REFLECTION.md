# Reflection

1. **Can I explain what my code does?**

   This code builds a trivia game where user sessions and scores are managed using cookies and localStorage. Each function in `script.js` contributes to managing the game state, from user authentication with cookies to displaying questions and storing scores.

2. **What was my coding process?**

   My process was to first plan the necessary functions based on the assignment requirements. Then, I implemented each function step-by-step, verifying functionality at each stage, before moving on.

3. **What challenges did I have?**

   The biggest challenge was managing the flow of data between sessions and ensuring scores persisted correctly. I tested each feature individually to resolve issues.

4. **What would I do differently now?**

   In the future, Iâ€™d focus more on planning data structures, possibly adding unique IDs to each score entry to better organize game sessions.
